# Credit where credit is due.

The code in this project is pretty generic Unity, using standard assets. Here are the notable additional assets used to build it.

### WebGL Input
For some reason, Unity does not support copy/paste in WebGL. Thank you very much to the creator of this package:

### JSON Parsing
We used the very popular Newtonsoft.Json library to process the responses from the LLM.
